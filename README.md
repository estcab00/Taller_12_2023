# Workshop on Web Scraping and Text Information Retrieval

## Overview
This workshop focuses on using Python programming tools for collaborative development, web data extraction, and information retrieval from documents. Participants will learn to:
1. Use GitHub for collaborative projects.
2. Develop effective Web Scraping tools.
3. Retrieve and process relevant information from text documents.

## Working on the Cloud for the Text Information Retrieval Section
The Text Information Retrieval section involves installing and managing multiple dependencies if you choose to work locally. For those who prefer a cloud-based approach for this section, Colab-adapted scripts are available. You can access them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yPdrPUBHmmu9c9WGF8BLDcYc6sytyeQ?usp=sharing). To use these scripts, download the folder, unzip it, and upload it to your Google Drive. Alternatively, if you decide to work locally, follow the instructions provided in the notebooks for `session 3` and `session 4`.
